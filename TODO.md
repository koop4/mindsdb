# TODO v0.8.8

- Make all problems classification problems. For numeric, date, use buckets with 3% error margin

- Update results to be a most likely value for prediction with a probability distribution, we can use this as the output of the softmax

# TODO v0.8.9

- Implement previous step to training the full model,  for encoders-decoders to be trained

- Use encoders to encode all full text columns first and then use the encoded value as the normalized value
